# Installation

You can install Soshiki using TestFlight or using a service such as AltStore or SideStore that allows you to sideload .ipa files.

<br />

### TestFlight Installation

1. Join the Soshiki [Discord](/discord) Server.
2. In the **#testflight** channel, click the button at the bottom that says "**Invite Me**".
3. Provide your email in the popup. 
4. Check your email for an email inviting you to the beta, and press the button that says "**View in TestFlight**".
5. Download TestFlight from the App Store.
6. Install Soshiki from TestFlight after accepting the invitation.

<br />

### Manual Installation

Download the latest version of **Soshiki** by going to the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/soshikimoe/soshiki-ios/releases/) page. If you're jailbroken, have AltStore or SideStore already set up, or have another method of installation, this may be the simplest option, but also requires you to sideload a new ipa after every app update.

# Installing Sources

With Soshiki installed, you can now add sources to add content to your library.

<br />

Go to the Soshiki [Discord](/discord) server, and navigate to the **#sources-and-trackers** channel. Here, you can find links that can be added in the settings page that installs sources and trackers that have been made.
